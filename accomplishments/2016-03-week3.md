### Week in Review

- What a week, we had a blizzard and I built a little site that uses the Twitter streaming API. The blizzard was the 10th largest in Denver history, 19.5 inches of snow! It was nuts. I was very nervous about the twitter site. It involved learning a lot of new stuff and I didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. However, I managed to get it done. This has given me some confidence to bit off a bit more next week, I'm starting to believe that I can actually do this stuff. The site itself is fairly simple, it counts how my times MLB teams have been tweeted about using their hashtags. Until next week!
