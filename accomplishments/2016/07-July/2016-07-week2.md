### Week in Review

- As you can see I didn't get a lot done this week. Not great. Going forward I will not dwell in the past, I need to learn from my mistakes. Alaina pointed out that breaking my tasks down into smaller parts has worked in the past. She is absolutely right, starting next week I'll be using the weekly steps file a lot more. One weird thing about last week was that I didn't feel bad about not doing much. Maybe I needed a little time off. I'm still not used to the stress of having a job, I need to take it slow sometimes.
