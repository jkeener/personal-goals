### Week in Review

- I got some things done this week. The Tour pages have finally started moving forward. I have to finish them this week before I go on vacation. Lots of goals weren't finished again this week, I can blame getting violently ill for some of it...but not all. It takes me so long getting over a breakdown it can be very frustraiting/discouraging. I'm trying, that's all I can ask of myself.
