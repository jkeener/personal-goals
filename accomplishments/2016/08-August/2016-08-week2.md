### Week in Review

- This is more like a month in review! I decided not to do goals while I was on my 2 week-long vacation. It was the right call. The first week was a relaxing time spent in Michigan with family. Meeting my baby niece was the highlight to end all highlights! Then I went to Arizona for a week of birding. It was a great trip, though it was trying at times. I ended up with 44 lifers for the trip which, while a tiny bit lower that I was hoping for, wasn't bad at all. I got almost all of my most wanted birds. After all the hectic travels I feel rejuvenated, lets see how long that lasts.
