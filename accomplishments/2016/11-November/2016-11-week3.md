### Week in Review

- Well, I didn't do my goals this week but I'm trying to not feel to bad about it. I had a nice time at Thanksgiving with friends and a great long weekend with Alaina. This website thing is really freaking me out and I need to get my shit together about it. I'm never going to be able to hold down a full-time job if everything derails me. I can do it. 

### Our movie(s) from the list this week were:

- The Magnificent Seven
- Children of Men
