### Week in Review

- The weather had it in for me at the end of the week, snow for three days straight! I still managed to get out. Early in the week I had a nice birding trip to Boulder and picked up 15 year birds for Boulder County. Going to the gym in the snow wasn't fun but I made myself do it, same goes to the walk Alaina and I took! My spirits are high, I'm going to keep this train rolling. See you next week.
