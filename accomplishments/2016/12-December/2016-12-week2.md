### Week in Review

- Pretty good week all in all. I didn't endup doing the tours because the boss told me not too. The email I sent him turned out to be very timly and I'm looking forward to moving forward on the project. This week was the first time in a long time I didn't do my gym goal. I have a new rule that when it is below 0 I'm not going! We are going to Georgia on thursday and coming back the following Thursday, so I'll miss doing goals next week. I'll see you in 2017!
