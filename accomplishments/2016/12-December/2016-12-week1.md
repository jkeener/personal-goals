### Week in Review

- Pretty good week all in all. The site got fixed, it took 5 seconds which was quite a relief. I still need to do the brainstorming, but I'm trying not to dwell on my failures. I'm doing my best to become a reluctant optimist. Next week I'm gong to try to work on the site more, I'll put some tours up and email Kevin because I'm not sure what he is looking for. I told him that I had done as much as I could and he gave no feedback, so I'll try again!
