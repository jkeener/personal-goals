### Week in Review

- This week I did pretty well. The CSS books are shorter than I thought so I should be able to knock the next one out this week. I'm feeling good that at least I'm doing some self improvment/learning instead of stagnating. I hope that if I keep at it good things will happen eventually. 

### Our movie(s) from the list this week were:

- Roman Holiday
- A Touch of Evil
