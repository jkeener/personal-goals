### Week in Review

- I'm getting older. I twisted my knee getting out of my chair and haven't been able to run. It is frustrating knowing I could do it if it wasn't for the pain. I'm hoping it isn't really bad, I'll take it easy this week. Alain and I have a 5k coming up and I don't want to pull out. Next week I want to get going on the site, no matter how infuriating it is.
