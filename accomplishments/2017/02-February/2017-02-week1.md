### Week in Review

- That was a quite a miscalculation about how long it would take to do the portfolio project. It took me 2 days and I received full marks. Instead of doing nothing for the rest of the week, I moved to the next section. The javascript quizzes are giving me difficulties, but that is how I'll improve! Another good week, see you later!
