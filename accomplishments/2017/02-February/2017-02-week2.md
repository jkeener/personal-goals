### Week in Review

- This week went well, although I didn't get as much done as I wanted to. The Javascript course was frustrating. Not with difficulty, but with the format. The project is going to be very annoying to finish, I'm not looking for it. I'm going to try to look stay positive and nail it this this week.

### Our movie(s) from the list this week were:

- Close Encounters of the Third Kind
