- I didn't realize that the first gook in You don't know JS was only 3 chapters...So I also started Scope & Closures, but I'm not going to change the goal.
- Learned a bit about three.js, did part of a nodeschool lesson on it.
- Didn't do a pull request for Cssgram, but I made one.

- [ ] At least one video from CSS-Tricks 'Learn jQuery from Scratch' a day.
- [ ] Build something with the Twitter API (streaming).
- [ ] Do the Photoshop for the chrome app.
- [ ] Page from MDN Javascript guide a day.
- [ ] 10 push ups a day (I'm starting slow!).
- [ ] Read 3 articles from Pocket.

### Week in Review
- This week was up and down. Sometimes personal life can get in the way of us being more productive than we should be, and that is ok. That being said, I still got quite a lot done. Most of my work went into a silly Chrome app I'm building that will hopefully be out in a week or two. I'm building it as practice, I love reading but to actually wrap my head around some of this stuff I need to get rid of the fear and just build. I've been going to the gym twice a week instead of once...killin it. Another reason that productivity was down a bit this week is that Daredevil season 2 just came out...soooo bye!
