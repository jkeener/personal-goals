# This Weeks Accomplishments: March 06, 2016

## This Week's Goal: Webpack!

## Things I Did From the List:

- Get better at markdown: Did some tuts and practiced by working on this goals repo :)  
- Go to the gym at least once: Rode the bike, it was good!

### Additional Things I Did:

- rewrote most of the css for my personal site. I had a lot of unnecessary repetition and bad flexbox stuff. Also fixed the ridiculous media queries I had.
- wrote an animated svg of the colorado flag, for future use on my website. It is awesome.
- worked on my Linkedin
- did a pull-request to CSSGram, I got the build to work on my computer finally. Though I'm not sure it will work for everyone else...so there is that.
