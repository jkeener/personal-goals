Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals

1. Learn Spanish.
2. Exercise more.
3. Be kind.
4. Have fun.
5. Go birding more.
6. Do more art
