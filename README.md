Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals

3. Use Twitter more.
4. Get better at JS.
5. Exercise more.
6. Be kind.
7. Have fun.
8. Go birding a lot.
9. Do more art
