Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Contribute to Open Source
3. Use Twitter more
4. Get better at JS
5. Exercise more
6. Be kind
7. Have fun
